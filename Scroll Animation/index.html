                <h2>Audi RS6 Avant/RS7</h2>
                <p>Audi’s latest V-8–powered RS cars offer similar below-the-beltline musculature with your choice of greenhouse and roofline. The RS6 Avant and RS7 look like their pedestrian A-level siblings on a steady drip of steroids, with every surface
                    flexed and exaggerated.</p>
                <p>Both feature wider fenders and a lower ride height, lending them an aggressive but elegant presence on the road. The RS6 Avant is a welcome challenger to the Mercedes-AMG E63S at the top of the miniscule U.S. wagon market.</p>

                <h2>Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio</h2>
                <p>Alfa Romeo's pointy, shield-shaped grille may not be for everyone, but the Giulia wears it well and the rest of the car is truly gorgeous. This sport sedan is perfectly proportioned, with a long hood and a cabin set back toward the rear
                    wheels, and the body surfacing and details are exquisite.</p>
                <p>And every Giulia shares the same good looks; Alfa Romeo doesn't muck up the base models or reserve the choicest flourishes for the range-topping, high-performance Giulia Quadrifoglio. We think that the base Giulia's tamer front and rear
                    bumpers, lack of side vents, and additional chrome trim actually add to the design's appeal.

                <h2>Aston Martin DBS Superleggera</h2>
                <p>If any automaker knows how to make a beautiful car, it's Aston Martin. The DBS Superleggera is both the brand's newest model and the best expression of its current design language.</p>
                <p>While it is based on the DB11, the DBS's bodywork is unique save for the roof. The whale shark–like grille design somehow isn't too big, its yawning opening harking back to Astons of yore, and the squared-off rear, short front overhang,
                    and wide fenders give it excellent proportions.

                <h2>Bentley Flying Spur</h2>
                <p>As beautiful inside as its stately exterior suggests, the Flying Spur has amenities that could shame Air Force One. The newest edition of the Spur features more athletic styling than its predecessors, with creased, muscular haunches in
                    the rear that flow into a handsomely sculpted, square-jawed front end. Inside, each and every nuanced detail has been taken into account.</p>
                <p>From the rich leather swaddling nearly every touchable surface, to the genuine wood trim, and knurled metal switchgear, this aristocrat exudes class.

                <h2>Bugatti Chiron</h2>
                <p>Bugatti's Veyron, while striking and undeniably iconic thanks to its record-setting top speed, was not necessarily an attractive car. To many it was stubby, bulbous, and weird-looking. While only incrementally faster, its successor, the
                    Chiron, is a whole lot prettier.</p>
                <p>The design is more aggressive, with larger air scoops and vents. The whole rear end is practically one big mesh grille with taillights stuffed into its void. Each side of the car is dominated by a C-line that curves around the doors and
                    visually splits the body into two distinct sections.
